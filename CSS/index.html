                A <b>central processing unit (CPU)</b>, also called a central processor, main processor or just <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_(computing)">processor</a>, is
                the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program.
                The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by
                the
                instructions in the program.
                This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry,<sup

                specialized processors
                such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</p>

                The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation
                remains
                almost unchanged.
                Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic
                operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations,
                and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by
                directing the
                coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.</p>


            <p>
                Most modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, with one or more CPUs on a
                single
                metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) IC chip.
                Microprocessors chips with multiple CPUs are multi-core processors.
                The individual physical CPUs, processor cores, can also be multithreaded to create additional virtual or
                logical
                CPUs.[2]</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The design complexity of CPUs increased as various technologies facilitated building smaller and more
            reliable
            electronic devices. The first such improvement came with the advent of the transistor.
            Transistorized CPUs during the 1950s and 1960s no longer had to be built out of bulky, unreliable and
            fragile
            switching elements like vacuum tubes and relays.[28]
            With this improvement, more complex and reliable CPUs were built onto one or several printed circuit boards
            containing discrete (individual) components.
            In 1964, IBM introduced its IBM System/360 computer architecture that was used in a series of computers
            capable
            of running the same programs with different speed and performance.[29]
            This was significant at a time when most electronic computers were incompatible with one another, even those
            made by the same manufacturer. To facilitate this improvement, IBM used the concept of a microprogram (often
            called "microcode"), which still sees widespread usage in modern CPUs.[30]
            The System/360 architecture was so popular that it dominated the mainframe computer market for decades and
            left
            a legacy that is still continued by similar modern computers like the IBM zSeries.[31][32]
            In 1965, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) introduced another influential computer aimed at the scientific
            and
            research markets, the PDP-8.[33]</p>

        <h3 id="subtopic">Small-scale integration CPUs</h3>
        <p>
            During this period, a method of manufacturing many interconnected transistors in a compact space was
            developed.
            The integrated circuit (IC) allowed a large number of transistors to be manufactured on a single
            semiconductor-based die, or "chip".
            At first, only very basic non-specialized digital circuits such as NOR gates were miniaturized into ICs.[37]
            CPUs based on these "building block" ICs are generally referred to as "small-scale integration" (SSI)
            devices.
            SSI ICs, such as the ones used in the Apollo Guidance Computer, usually contained up to a few dozen
            transistors.
            To build an entire CPU out of SSI ICs required thousands of individual chips, but still consumed much less
            space
            and power than earlier discrete transistor designs.[38]
            IBM's System/370, follow-on to the System/360, used SSI ICs rather than Solid Logic Technology
            discrete-transistor modules.[39][40] DEC's PDP-8/I and KI10 PDP-10 also switched from the individual
            transistors
            used by the PDP-8 and PDP-10 to SSI ICs,[41]
            and their extremely popular PDP-11 line was originally built with SSI ICs but was eventually implemented
            with
            LSI components once these became practical.</p>
